52931,Distll,IOS - Sprint 24 Bugs Part 1,,iOS Developer
52931,Distll,Sprint 24 bugs Backend + Admin UI,,Backend Developer
52931,Distll,Make a switch to transite from a Distll Admin to a Brand Admin,The goal of this US is implement the transition to a Brand Admin before implementing any Brand specific feature,Backend Developer
52931,Distll,Create PreProduction environment,As part of this item we have:* setup servers* setup de deployment pipeline* setup autoscaling,Backend Developer
52931,Distll,Beautiful Losers - Only Twitter content is seen by default,I think this is happening because of how everything was injested. Probably we will need to give random upload dates to articles to make them apear randomly,Backend Developer
52931,Distll,Image Loading times are Very Slow,"The traffic is very slow. Image take a lot of time to load. We suppose that is because the servers are on Argentina. We can think on some cache strategies.The app is very image heavy, If i remember correctly the complaint here was mostly about the images and not so much about the connection. On the front end, we can't do much about the response time of the json load if the servers are in Argentina. We need to make AWS replicas here in the US.With regard to a suggested solution for fixing images, we should use SGImageCache. SeatGeek is a highly respected (and image heavy) ticketing app in the US. Using their library could greatly improve perceived image loading times in tables. I used this library in a previous project and it worked very well.https://github.com/seatgeek/SGImageCacheHowever, Taka brought up a great point that most of our images sizes are too big for a fast iterative view.We need to pair down the image size to be more reasonable for download. That is we need transcoding to be effective for images that go into s3 and our attached to the Distll API.  To start I suggest we use images of size 640x640. Further down the line we might want to able to select the image size using a parameter, per device, like size=640x640.  Many image apis do the same including the facebook places api.Besides Image Caching and transcoding the images, we can also prefetch more cells in the background, and also reduce like the parallax effect and stretching images by 30% since they'll be coming in smaller than some device sizes might want for full width of the device.",iOS Developer
52931,Distll,Apple Submit For Review of Beautiful Losers,We need to prepare the app for Apple's submission and push it to testflight so apple can give us feedback if needed,iOS Developer

52931,Distll,IOS - Article image dissapears after entering the view,"The transition animation works well, but the full resolution image is not displayed. It's happened with sources ""Athletic Recon - RSS"" and ""Chet Faker - SoundCloud"".",iOS Developer
52931,Distll,Home feed UI improvements,"- ""DISTLL"" at the top should be in Helvetica Neue Bold font- Display a little ""source"" logo to the right of the source name. E.g. ""Pitchfork - Facebook"" should be ""Pitchfork <fb logo>"", etc.- Change message during pull to refresh, from ""Pull Down To Refresh"" to ""Release To Refresh""- Improve article titles following Christian's guidelines:  > You’ll notice that the font size of the titles in the Distll demo are much larger than what we have currently in the app. However those are shorter titles in the demo. In the Pharrell demo there are longer article titles and the size of the font is smaller than in the Distll demo, although both appear larger than what we currently have. Can someone verify (or not) if the font size in the Pharrell demo is larger than what we’re using in the actual app?  > In the Pharrell demo, the titles are longer and take up much more room than what we currently allow. They are spaced away from the color blocks on the right but run taller up the image….more vertically. I actually like that and wonder if we should maybe allow 4 lines of text and buffer them away from the color blocks like in the Pharrell demo. I’d like to see what that looks like. For extremely long titles, twitter and ig posts, etc, we should still use the … and truncate the title- Tweak the parallax effect with Christian (he can't even detect it)",iOS Developer

That backup system will be used as a new and improved startup system, to setup the brand id's for production servers, and it will aid continuous delivery, by dividing the data between content and proper app setup data that could be setup on the app's creation process.

RSS and other native sources from websites proper should just be listed as: Pitchfork (not as Pitchfork RSS)b.) Facebook sources should be displayed as their proper Facebook name (as they’re listed on Facebook itself) with a white little facebook logo to the right of it. So, it would be: Pitchfork (fb logo in white)c.) Twitter sources should be displayed as their handle followed by the Twitter bird logo in white to the right. Ex: @pitchfork (all white bird logo)d.) Instagram should be displayed the same,….handle name and then IG logo in all white. @pitchfork (logo)e.) YouTube sources should be handled the same as Facebook sources….. sources should be displayed as their proper YouTube name (as they’re listed on YouTube itself) with a white little YT logo to the right of it.

The title of the article should be Helv Neue Bold in ALL CAPS. I just realized that we arent doing this with the current product. I cant remember if we discussed this and made a decision to make the title NOT in all capital letters, but I do prefer the way the ALL CAPS looks in the title and would like to see what that looks like in the next version of the build.The #Source credit should sit right under the title as designed. (in this case High Snobiety)on the second image, we show the tagged #Topics for this article in the grey bubbles at top. The date of the article should be right under the author's name in the same font/treatment as the author's name,.....in this case John Stevens.
