66937,OpenSwitch,Add support for specification of register fields that appear at different bit offsets.,"If an i2c device register contains several fields at different bit offsets, but with the same content, the definition of the field contents in the associated yaml file must define a different set of field value definition for each field.  This is awkward and makes the yaml file unnecessarily complex and hard to read.For example, say you have a fan LED control register that controls 4: LEDs - LED1-4.  Each LED has four possible states represented by two bits: 0 = off 1 = on 2 = slow blink 3 = fast blink.Currently, the yaml file would have two define four sets of values to represent the state of each individual LED making both the yaml file and source code to control the LEDs harder to read.fan_led1_values:    OFF1:     0x00    ON1:      0x01    SLOW1: 0x02    FAST1:   0x03fan_led2_values:    OFF2:     0x00    ON2:      0x06     SLOW2: 0x08    FAST2:   0x0Cfan_led3_values:    OFF3:     0x00    ON3:      0x10    SLOW3: 0x20    FAST3:   0x30fan_led4_values:    OFF4:     0x00    ON4:      0x60     SLOW4: 0x80    FAST4:   0xC0The i2c op definition should allow for a single definition of field values regardless of what bit offset the field is located.I propose that a 'shift' value be added to the register description.
