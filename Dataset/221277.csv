I believe this may cause problems, as audits typically take longer than 24 hours to complete, and it would become onerous to prevent access to audit forms each time unless Building DNA is confirmed, when realistically, they wouldn't be on site each time they revisit the audit form.As such, had the idea of packaging up multiple forms that all require 'completing', to finish a process.

This column will hold the id of the watch the appliance belongs to when it was assigned to the incident.

The functions ""f_callsigns_create"" and ""f_callsigns_update"" should be updated so that the ""watch_id"" column is populated.The ""facts.incident_callsigns_view"" should also be updated with a new column - ""watch"" - which should hold a textual description of the watch the appliance was on when it was assigned to the associated incident.
