For that we need to keep all sensible stuff in trusted repo, for rdo it's ""config/"" repo.1.  Jobs that have secrets usage should be defined in config/ repo only. Uploading job currently uses a hack with ssh-agent to prevent password for image server leak. But seems like it's difficult to do the same for dlrn passwords, docker registry, etc. So container build, promoting to testing repo jobs should be in config/ repo.2.  Secrets defined in config/ repo for post playbooks should be safe. If it's defined in pre/post playbook, it's available only in these playbooks.3.  Jobs that are defined in config repo should be blocked from inheritance. ""final: true"" in job definition. So that you can't define inherited job in untrusted repo and run on your hacky patch.4.  Scripts that can expose passwords should be moved to config/ repo from ci-scripts. In order to prevent inserting there compromising code in patch. (like ""echo $MY_PASSWORD"")The whole idea is to keep sensitive data in trusted repo. The trusted repo differs from untrusted by that you can't run ""trusted"" jobs on patches.For example if you want to run promote-to-testing job on your patch, you can't - because it's defined in trusted repo.

289231,TripleO CI (production),Add  job definition for scenario 1 standalone job and featureset if needed,"Normally when adding a new job we would need a new featureset to use with the job definition (or re-use an existing one). In this case we only need to override a single parameter, beyond the 'normal' standalone featureset 052\. We need to pass the standalone_custom_env_files  parameter with which we can specify which tripleo heat templates environment file we want (scenario 1 env file in this case, from [6] ). Thus instead of reserving and defining a new featureset, copied from fs 052 (standalone) just to override this standalone_custom_env_files we will instead use the featureset_override mechanism.This needs to be restricted however so as not to allow general purpose override of environment files here as that is not the intent. So we can assume for example that all files specified are relative to /usr/share/openstack-tripleo-heat-templates. Furthermore, rather than exposing the standalone_custom_env_files we can define and use a new/dedicated standalone_scenario_environment parameter for use in the job definition featureset_override, and this will then be processed before passing to the deployment as standalone_custom_env_files. The standalone_scenario_environment can then be re-used across all scenario standalone jobs we define.The current multinode scenario 1 jobs [2] should be retired as part of this task. Besides removing the job definition we must also post reviews to all projects that are referring to the tripleo-ci-centos-7-scenario001-multinode-oooq and oooq-container jobs [4]. We might aim to remove the existing job at the same time as adding the replacement. An advantage of this is that we can re use the existing scenario1 featureset (005) rather than defining a new one as discussed in [3]. However, this can quickly get messy as we discovered at [5] (dependencies) .
